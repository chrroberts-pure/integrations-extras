      requried: false
      description: |
        Whether to collect heap, mutex, or block profiles as cumulative profiles
        since the program started. If false, requests those profiles over the
        period specified by "duration". The profiles will hold the difference
        between the samples at the beginning and end of profiling.

        For the heap profile, the in-use (also known as "live heap") samples
        may be negative if "cumulative" is false. This does not display
        accurately in the profile UI, so Datadog does not recommend setting
        "cumulative" to false.
        
        In order to use profile aggregation, "cumulative" must set to false.
        Note that setting "cumulative" to false will cause the profiled
        application to use more memory in order to compute the profiles.

          This changes the collection interval of the check. For more information, see:
          https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/#collection-interval

          This is a long-running check, and is intended to be started again as
          soon as it finishes. Setting this to a larger value will cause longer
          pauses between iterations of this check.

          If omitted, will default to 15 seconds.

        service.description: |
          Service name to tag on every profile uploaded for this instance.

          Overrides any `service` defined in the `init_config` section.
