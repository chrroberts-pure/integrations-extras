# Twingate

## Overview

[Twingate][1] is a zero trust network access platform that allows fast growing companies to quickly and easily provide secure access to their AWS environment. By incorporating modern technologies such as NAT traversal, QUIC, private proxies, and split tunneling, Twingate can replace a traditional or cloud VPN while improving user performance and overall security.

This integration allows organizations to monitor a user's resource access activities in real time.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
1. You have the Datadog Agent installed on the Twingate Connector server. You must be able to connect to that host and edit the files to configure the Agent and YAML Integration Configs. To install the Datadog Agent, see [Getting Started with the Agent][11].
2. You must deploy the Twingate Connector. To enable real-time connection logs, see the [Twingate documentation][3].

### Configure the Datadog Agent
#### Systemd
1. Set up [Datadog journald integration][5].
2. Replace `journald.d/conf.yaml` with the following configuration:
   ```
    logs:
      - type: journald
        container_mode: true
        include_units:
          - twingate-connector.service
        service: Twingate Connection
        source: Twingate
        log_processing_rules:
        - type: include_at_match
          name: analytics
          pattern: ANALYTICS
        - type: mask_sequences
          name: remove_analytics
          replace_placeholder: ""
          pattern: "ANALYTICS "
   ```
3. Add the `dd-agent` user to the `systemd-journal` group by using `usermod -a -G systemd-journal dd-agent`.
4. Restart the Datadog Agent by running `service datadog-agent restart`.
5. Confirm that the Twingate Analytic log appears in the [Log Explorer][10].

### Twingate Analytics Dashboard
1. Go to the Datadog [Dashboard List][12].
